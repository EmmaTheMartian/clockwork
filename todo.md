# To Do

- [ ] Automatically recognize `.vsh` files as tasks in `scripts/`?
	- Perhaps they could use comments at the top of the file to define their
	`help`, `depends`, and `work_dir`.
- [x] Global task to generate a blank Clockwork project
- [x] Make the install task symlink itself instead of copying to `~/.local/bin`
- [x] Include Maple as a submodule
- [x] Installation VSH script!
- [ ] Tests tests tests
